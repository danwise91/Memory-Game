# Memory-Game
Created by: Daniel Wise

## Introduction
A fun take on the classic memory game, where you must flip over several cards until you get pairs that match. This game was coded in
HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript. 

## How to play
Click on one of the 16 cards you see on the grid to flip them over. For every 2 cards you flip it will count as 1 move. The less moves you 
make the better your rating will be. As you go through the game you will be rated on your performance by the total numbers of stars you
receive (3 stars = excellent, 2 stars = great, 1 star = you did alright). Keep a careful eye on the timer and try to beat your best time.
If you ever need to refresh the game and try again there is a handy refresh button in the top right hand corner of the grid. Have fun 
playing!

## Dependencies
